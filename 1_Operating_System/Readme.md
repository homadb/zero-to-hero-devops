## Operating System - Basic Concepts
### Applications
* Apps don't know how to talk to the hardware
* Apps, like browser can't be installed directly on the hardware
* CPU - Memory - Storage - I/O devices (Hardware of Computer)

### Operating System
* Translator!
* Manages Resources among applications

#### 1) Resource Allocation and Management
##### Process Management
###### What is a process?
* small unit that executes on the computer
* each process has own isolated space

####### 1 CPU
* 1 process at a time
* 1 CPU can only process 1 task at a time

##### Memory Management
* allocating working memory
* every application needs some data to work
* RAM (Rapid Access Memory) is limited on the computer

###### Memory Swapping :exclamation:
* OS swaps memory between applications
* one app becomes inactive, new one gets resources
* That process takes some time!

##### Storage Management

###### Data we want to save:
* your produced files, code
* VSC code that runs the app itself
* files - browser configurations - games - pictures - videos
