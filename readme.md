* on team per app or per feature

#### Software Testing
* test the new features
* test the old code/fuctionality
* testing is done by developers and dedicated testers
* automated testing

#### Release of Software
* build application
* run on servers
* upgrade existing software

#### Operation
* run software in production

### Traditional: Development vs Operations
#### Development
* programming languages
* test frameworks
* databases
* version control

#### Operations
* OS, mostly Linux
* command-line
* scripting
* monitoring tools

### Solution: DevOps culture
* DevOps was just a way of working between DEV's and OP's
* Common language to communicate
* Became its own role and job

### DevOps tasks and responsibilities
* needs some know-how from DEV and OP's team
* additional DevOps specificskills and know-how

### Waterfall vs. Agile
* influences speed and process of software development
* the way on organization is developing applications

#### Traditional WATERFALL
* Requirements: plan everything beforehand
* Development: developers code complete app
* Testing: testing after everything has developed
* Operations: huge perparation
* ineffective process:x:
* over time new requirments may arise:x:
* many places of failure and miscommunicatin:x:
* no fast feedback:x:

#### Benefits of Agile
* speed of development, testing and deployment cycles:white_check_mark:
* each feature gets tested, deployed
* immediate feedback
* fast development and deployment process
* scrum and kanban - specific implementations
